      <h4>1. Our Services</h4>
      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
        distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
        regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so
        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
      </p>
